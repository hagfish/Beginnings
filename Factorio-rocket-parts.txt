One rocket per hour:

= One satellite per hour
		=	50 acid, 500 solid fuel, 4200 iron, 7300 copper, 1500 steel, 
			900 plastic, 500 batteries

= control unit = 
	(0.5 acid + 39 iron + 72.5 cu + 12 plastic + 30s) 
	* 100 = 50 acid, 3900 iron, 7250 cu, 1200 plastic / hour
	
= fuel (10 * solid fuel + 30s) * 10

= LDS (10 steel + 5 cu + 5 plastic + 30s)
		= 1000 steel + 500 cu + 500 plastic
		
1 of each component / second = 1000s/rocket = 16 mins
With productivity boots, that's down to below 10 mins, probably
		
* 10 for Rocket Parts:
1000 acid
39,000 iron
116,500 cu
17,000 plastic
10,000 steel

Totals incl satellite
11,500 steel
123,800 copper
43,200 iron
17,900 plastic (and 9000 coal)
500 batteries

Per second:
Steel: 		3.19 (from 16 iron)
Copper: 	35
Iron: 		12 (total of 28) (going to need fast belts)
Plastic: 	5 from three full-supplied factories, needing 9 petrol/second
			needing 8 advanced refineries. Maybe just make it 1:1, and have a 
			sulphur factory, too. Crude to light to petrol to sulphur. Light oil
			to solid fuel.
			Nine refineries (4MW) will need 90 crude per 10 seconds
				or 9 crude per second
				or 9 100% pumps, or 90 10% pumps (8MW). Fewer with speed modules.

Requires 2(35+28) = 90 miners, 50 smelters (requiring 17MW)

Power supply for 35MW
30 engines, and 42 boilers or
600 solar panels, 500 accumulators (100 of those 9x9 blueprints)

================
Soo, let's say I have 30 10% oil patches
Without speed that's 3 crude/second, or maybe up to 10/s with speed and beacons

Soo, 10 crude/s using ALL of the petrol and light for petrol = 8.5 petrol/s

This will make (almost) 6 plastic/second
Which will support 24 Red Circuit mills...

So 10 crude/s should support 20 red circuits factories

Which will also require:
6 green circuits/second (3 factories consuming (6 iron + 9 coils/s) from 3 dedicated coils factories, needing 4.5 cu/s)
and 10 coils/s (from 5 factories, consuming 6 cu/s)

Totals raw is ~10 Cu/s, 6 Fe/s, 6 plastic, 3 coal, 10 crude
	or 5/3/3/2/5 for 10 red circuit factories

Or in general, you can support twice the number of red circuit factories as you have crude/s

=========
One forward base requ:
Pumpjacks
Level 3 factory
Train station
beacon
robo port (with repair packs and construction bots)
provider chest (laser turrets)
laser turrets
walls
Lots of speed 3 modules
Concrete

================
For a rocket-building base built around 16 red circuits factories
making 2 red circ/second (requires 4 green circuits/second (output of 2 factories))

Speed1 (5/5/15s) + BlueCird (20/2/15s)

One pair of Speed1/BlueCirc requires 7 red/15s (or 0.5/s)
So 16 recCirc will feed 4 pairs.
These four pairs will create 1 pair of chips every 4s
RCUs require 1/1/30s
So 1 pair per 4s will feed (almost) 8 RCU fabs

8 coils (16Cu/s, from 32 miners, and 20 furnaces)
6 greenCirc (12Fe/s, from 24 miners and 15 furnaces)
16 red 
4 blueCirc
4 speed1
8 RCU = 0.25 RCU/s = 1.1 hours

==============
Solar power
1 panel = 15Fe, 28Cu, 5Steel (15 green circuits, 5Cu, 5 Steel)
1 accumulator = 2Fe, 5 batteries (battery = 1Fe, 1Cu, 2 acid (1 acid = 1 sulphur + 0.2Fe))
6 panels + 5 accumulators = 360W
18 panels + 15 accumulators ~= 1MW
180 panels + 150 accumulators = 10MW = 30 blueprints

= 750 batteries = 1500 acid = 1500 sulphur, 300 Fe
100MW = 7500 batteries = 15K sulphur = 22,500 Petrol
7500 batteries = 10 hours at speed 0.
10 factories will need 4 acid/second (output of one factory) supplied by 4 sulphur/second (output of 2 factories) supplied by 6 petrol/second (output of ~5 refineries...)
May need to shut down plastic for a while. Crack more heavy/medium.
And that's just for 100MW/hour.

Will need lots of stone for walls and lots of turrets (12 batteries per turret).

1GW = 3K blueprints = 75K batteries = 225K Petrol
= 50x50 blueprints = 500x500 tiles. Will need lots of turret creep to clear/hold such an area. Maybe lay down the outside square first. 25x25 x six (625 patches = 4K panels/3K acc

Or eight 20x20 outpost installs

=============

modules (production and speed) and solar. Two automation lines for speed, prodn,
	Space, walls, defence, landfill
After that: beacons
Then: More resource nodes
Then: finish science X
cog > basic > fast > smart

8 red, 5 batteries, 1 filter inserter, 17 steel
12 blue sci (1/s)
3600/hour, 16K required = 4.4 hours production.
Will require/feed 30 labs for consumption in 4.4 hours.
1/s red sci requires 5 fabs (1 cogs/second (0.5 fab))
1/s green sci requires 6 fabs (1 basic inserters(1 cogs, 1 green circ(1 coils))(, 1 conveyors(1 cogs, iron))

Maybe put green circuits on a bus right by the furnaces. 3Cu + 2Fe/s = 2 circuits
Times 10 = 30Cu + 20Fe/s, which is some..
Needs 100 miners and 88 furnaces to feed :/
Outpost = (a reasonable-sounding) 20 miners = 10 ore/second = one carriage-full of finished plates every 7-ish mins, if smelted on-site. Two carriages every 15-ish minutes.
Just have the train visit them one after another

If the green circuits were assembled off-site in 5 factories, I would need enough to make 12.5/second = 12.5Fe and 19Cu/s. Quite a bit.
4 Factories would make 10/s, and fill a carriage in 13 minutes (I think they stack to 200)
Less stuff to truck around. If I have 3Fe/2Cu, then 1Fe/1Cu can go to green, probably. Maybe assemble them at Western Oil. Only need space for 10 factories. Any imbalance in finished ores can go to steel, and go on the train. 

Downside is that I would need to shift the factory as the outpost depletes. Upside is less stuff to transport. 

Five outposts (3 iron, 2 copper), each with 20 miners and 18 smelters, and storage for 8K finished plates. Visit once every 10 mins should be plenty. Much easier to store plates than ore. Much much easier to store circuits than plates.

To fill a cargo wagon with green circuits == 8K circuits. One factory for 1.1 hours or 5 factories for 15 minutes. Feeding 5 factories requ 25 ore/s = 50 miners and 44 furnaces.
50 miners, to begin with, tho. Furnaces right there at the ore deposit (30Cu, 15Fe). Red belts.

Have this set up as a blueprint, to speed up development of new ore veins.
Maybe just have the miners as a 5x5 grid, and remove those that aren't necessary.
25 miners is only 12.5 ore/s. 
Blueprint for [miner]belt[miner]
Blueprint for ore loading into two cargo wagons (incl splitters)
(8 steel chests, 8 blue inserters, 8 green inserters, power poles, track, 7 splitters)
Blueprint for ore loading into one cargo wagon
(4 steel chests, 4 blue inserters, 4 green inserters, power poles, 3 splitters)
One each side of each cargo wagon.


Green circuits required = 2/s for red circuits, 7/s for blue sci,
8/s requ 4 fully stocked circuits fabs, and 4 fully stocked coils fabs.
 
Purple. 10 every 12 seconds means I need some boosts, or a second factory. 
Take over: resource nodes, large area of space. Original zone could be devoted to refining. - Plastic, sulphur, rocket fuel, barrels of lubricant --> a train.

Then: Moar rockets. If I can have 1.4x productivity throughout the chain, I may need only around 30% of the raws. (Ore * 1, Metal * 1.4, circuit * 1.4, component * 1, rocket * 1.4)
Budget on 1MW/factory or furnace.
Currently at 2.3K panels == 140MW (/2 = 70MW)

===============

To get one rocket part/second:

LOW DENSITY STRUCTURES
10 steel, 5Cu, 5Plastic, 30 seconds. With production boots, need only half this much of raw: 25Fe, 2.5, 2.5

Feeding 30 factories requ 300 steel, 150Cu, 150 plastic/30s
or 10/5/5/s


10 steel/s = 50Fe/s = 180 smelters and 200 miners.. 

Mine*1, Smelt*1.2, Steel*1.2, LDS * 1.4, Rocket * 1.4 = 2.8* for production, which means I only need 1/2.8=36% of the raws, or 72 miners., but 250 smelters because of the lag.

250 smelters at 500KWea = 125MW (or another 4K panels, 5K accumulators)
Space requ for this install == 150x150
Accumulator = 5 batteries, 10s - need 25K batteries
Panel = 5Steel, 15 greencirc = 25K Steel (125KFe) and 60K green circ
Maybe repurpose eastern to make green circ, and ship them in. Clear space for smelters.

=========
Productivity modules
level 1: 5g/5r/15s (8 factories = 40g+40r/60s == 8/min)
level 2: 4 lev1 / 5r/5b 30s (2 factories = 8lev1+10r+10b/60s = 4/min)
level 3: 5 lev2 / 5r/5b 60s (1 factory = 1/min)

Total/min = 55g/55r/15b(== 300g/30r)
Total = 355g/85r (requ 170g)
Total g = 525/min or output of 5 factories.
Total r = 85/min, or output of 12 factories. I have 16..
So 12red/8green supports 1 level3/min.
or 6 red/4 green = 1 every 2 mins
Just keep em ticking over. Maybe set up a zone for them, because feeding 300 furnaces will require a few productivity modules... (also 5K panels, 6K accumulators)

===
Need to acquire more resource nodes, and set up staging stations - one one each side.

300 furnaces will take up 300*9*2 tiles or 100x100-ish. 8x40, requ 175 ore/s. Saturate a blue belt = 20 green circ. Express belts required in volume. One belt can supply 70 furnaces (up to 90 with 2*productivity:3)
80 miners with 20/node = 4 nodes. One train wagon can deliver 2000 or enough to feed this for 50 seconds.
Plate buffer of  17 chests can store 68K plates

==========

Todo

Develop the oil node to the north east. 30 pumps, 60 speed modules, tanks, pipes, assembler building, rail head. Turrets, roboport, spare parts, walls.
Alt: refineries, storage, rail head. Onsite processing requires water. Make plastic and rocket fuel.

Explore another perimeter

Develop more ore nodes

Re-route western train to use eastern unloader. Deliver oil by pipeline. Or just belt it down. Typical node = 25 miners which mine 12 ore/second, so yellow belts are fine. Two nodes can merge onto red, and three/four onto blue. Blue perimeter bus, with a spur going to the smelters from the east. Need base dimensions. Based on 1000 to the side, need 4.5K blue belts.

All up: 42 cogs/s from 44Fe/s
Output of 21 factories

===
Lay out more power
If evolution is 1 (it seems to be) might as well use steam engines, fuelled by rocket fuel. Boiler requ 780KW. For 1GW out, need 2800 boilers, = 2.2GW in = 9 rocket fuel/s

9 rocket fuel/s 
= 90 solid fuel/s 
= 90 light/s 
= 171 crude/s 
	or 1710 0.1 pumps 
	or 570 0.3 pumps
	or (max) 342 0.5 pumps



===
Basic	= 10Crude 	-> 3 light 		+ 3 heavy -> cracked -> 2.25 light	= 5.25 light
Advanced= 10 crude 	-> 4.5 light 	+ 1 heavy -> cracked -> .75 light 	= 5.25 light
Might as well use Advanced, and get the extra petrol.

========
Next: Modularise factory.
Setup:

Refining
IN: crude oil, coal
INTERMEDIARY: solid fuel
OUT: plastic, rocket fuel (extra to support satellite)

Smelting (central)
IN: Ore
OUT: Iron plate, copper plate, steel

Then areas for:
Base expansion support
IN: plates, steel, plastic, sulphur
INTERMEDIARY: batteries, speed1 modules, red circuits, acid, engines
OUT: panels + accumulators, medium poles, walls, laser turrets, bots, radars (also to support satellites), concrete, assemblers (a box of 100), repair packs, red belts, blue inserters

4 belts through the centre with Cu/Fe, steel/plastic, green/cogs, batteries/Fe?? 

If  cogs are created onsite each time:
Fe/Cu, Pl/St batteries/Green

Solar panel: Cu, St, Green (left)
Accumulator: Fe, batteries (right)
lasers: batteries, Green, Steel (??)
lev 1 assembler: Green, cogs, fe
Lev 2 assembler: Green, cogs, fe, lev1
Lev 3 assembler: 4Speed1(5red/5green) + 2lev1
Repair packs: green + cogs
Electric miner: Fe + cogs + green
Yellow belt: Fe + cogs
Red belt: cogs + yellow belt
Blue belt: Red belt + cogs + lubricant

Yellow underground belt: 5 yellow belts + 10 Fe
Red underground belt: underground belts plus Fe??

Medium poles: steel, copper plate
Big poles: steel, cu

Engines: 
Brown: steel, cogs, pipes
Red: Green + lubricant + brown engine

Bot frame: red engine + batteries + steel + green
Bot: frame plus either green or red

Capsules
Defender: 3 cogs + 2 green + 1 piercing ammo (5Cu + 1St)
Distractor: 3 red + 4 defender
Destroyer: 1Speed1(5G/5R) + 4 distractor

Poison: coal, green, steel

Circuits
IN: Cu plate, Fe plate, sulphur, plastic water
INTERMEDIARY: green circuits, red circuits, blue circuits (also support satellite), speed1 modules
OUT: Rocket control units

====LDS 
IN: plastic, steel, copper
OUT: LDS (extra to support satellite)
For 1LDS/s need 10 steel/s = 50 Fe/s = 50 ore/s = 100 miners and two full red belts of ore. Requiring 175 Fe mills and 175 Steel mills... 350 mills. 
Steel mills need the effects of a Speed2 beacon to counter the extra productivity of the Productivity3 in the Fe mills.
Five Cu/s just needs 9 mills.
21 factories (with speed beacons)

Modules included (and mitigating productivity speed loss with beacons):
1 Fe ore =  1.2 Fe plate = 1.44 Steel = 2 LDS
So maybe I can halve the number of miners:
50 miners = 25 ore/s out; 25Ores in = 30Fe/s out; 30Fe/s in  7.1St/s out(Speed2); 7.1St/s in = 1LDS/s out

====For Rocket fuel
Refining (use Refining 2. Trust me. The 0.75x from Heavy to Light kills the bonus)
10 crude ~= 10SF
7.2 crude/s -> 1RF/s
or about 25 pumps @ 0.3/s

1 Refinery can handle 2 crude/s so need 4 refineries.

====Rocket Control Units
1/s = (.71 Blue + .71 Speed1)/s = Half regular inputs = (12.5G+2.5R)/s
= (9Fe+12Coil)/s + 2.5R/s


1 Rocket part/s = 0.0071 rockets/s =  140s/rocket or 2.5mins.


=====

Gold science (x2)

1x Speed1		5Red + 7Green		(10/25/5) + (7/11)	17Fe/27Cu/5Pl
1x BlueCirc		2Red + 20Green	 	(4/10/2) + (20/30)	24Fe/40Cu/2Pl/HS04
														41Fe, 67Cu, 7Pl/s
														
so 1 gold science/second = 8 factories, 20Fe, 34Cu, 4Pl /s
= 40Fe miners, 65Cu miners, and all the smelters.
= 28 red, 7 green 

Then there's rocket science, that needs all this again.

Enrichment
Mined uranium 10:1 U238 (plus 7/10,000U235)
3U238 -> 1 U235

19 U238 (+1 U235) = 10 fuel cells

1.9 U238 (or 19 ore) = 1 fuel cell = 200s of power
or 100s with two reactors
10 hours play with two reactors = 360 fuel cells, = 36*1.9 U238 = 69 U238...
A typical ore field of 150K uranium = 15K U238. So we're fine for power.

Filter Stack inserters remove/reload the U238
Filter Stack inserter removes U235
	Stack inserter removes >1 U235 (not sure if stack size over-ride is important)
	Basic inserter removes =1 U235 (not sure if stack size over-ride is important)
	
With speed modules, that's about 2 U235/minute. 20 minutes until you can start a second spinner. 10 minutes for a third, 7 mins for a fourth, then 8 U235/min thereafter. You can't eat it, and after a while it's just a waste of U238. I should probably shut them down. Keep 160 U235 on hand, and make the rest into fuel cells. 360 U235 + 7.2K U238 = 3.3K fuel cells.

Next job: go back to the old save and make blue prints of smelters, red circuits.
Back to new save and clean up smelting and circuits. 

Circuits
Bring more ore patches online: 1:2 Fe/Cu.
Then set up a circuit area that can spit out 50:50 Blue/Speed1, 1 of each per second.

Speed1	5G:5R	15Fe, 35Cu, 10Pl 
Blue	20G:2R	24Fe, 40Cu, 4Pl, HSO4
		25G:7R	39Fe, 75Cu, 14Pl per second.

Need a way to split red circuits 2:5 to support Blue:Speed1 = 2/7:5/7
or .28:.71, so .25:.75 is near enuf

7 red/s = 6 red factories, which is not that many.
25G/s for the Blue/Speed1 + 14/s for the red circuits = 20 factories, which is a lot.

One of each/second = 2 gold/second, which is pretty good, and should support RCUs, as well.
Gold Science = 
RCU = 30s, so many factories are required.

Big ore patches and an oil reserve to the south. Research WMD, clear, develop those patches. 

RED		5s	1cog (0.5s) + 	1cu	= 2Fe, 1Cu
GREEN	6s	1Basic (0.5s) + 1 belt (0.5s)	=	1.5Cu, 5.5Fe
Blue	12s	1Miner (2s) + 1Red (8s) + 1Engine	(20s, 1St, 1Cog, 2Pipe)		=	25Fe, 9.5Cu, 2Pl
Grey	5s	0.5Piercing (3s) + 0.5Gren (8s) + 0.5Turret(10s) = 23Fe, 8Cu, 0.5St, 5Coal
Purple	7s	0.5Assembler (0.5s) + 0.5Elec (20s) + 0.5Smelt (5s) = 16Fe, 15Cu, 5St, 5Pl, 0.5Elec, 5Brick (=10stone)
Gold	7s	0.5Batt(5s) + 0.5Blue (15s) + 0.5Speed1(15s) = 8Fe, 24Cu, 3.5Pl, 0.5Batt


Fe (as plate) 88.5 	= two blue belts
Cu	63				= 1.5 blue belts
Steel	12 (engines, furnaces, piercing ammo)
Pl	15.5 (red circuits)
Bricks (or stone, but bricks take less space) furnaces
Coal	5 grenades
Fe (total)	148.5
HS04	2 (batteries, blue circuits)
Lubricant	2 electric engines

300 ore smelters
40 will handle one of ore (20 per side) - 7 of these (2Cu, 3Fe, 2St) Could use braided belts, but meh.
1 Blue belt of Cu
1.5 Blue belt Fe for starters

Number per s	0.5
Fe miner	137.5
Cu miner	59
Fe smelt	240.625
Cu smelt	60.75
St smelt	165

Total mine	196.5 (90KW ea) = 18MW
Total smelt	466.375 (180KW ea) = 90MW

At that rate 5m-worth of Fe patches will last 33Ks, or 9 hours 
Going to have to RSO this map. 

0.5 LDS: 0.5/s = 7 steel/s = 35Fe/s = 65Fe -> 65St smelters and 75 miners on ~3 ore patches.

0.5 RCU: 0.5/s = 15 factories fed by 28 red factories and 20Green factories
40Fe/s + 65Cu/s + HSO4 + plastic

Fuel = 5 solid/s into 15 factories. Bring southern field online to make rocket fuel. 10 pumps = 100/s. Crack heavy to light, and process the lot. 
10 crude in takes 5s
8 solid fuel per 3s. 

So how about we go with 0.5/s, with some speed/productivity modules in/around the silo?
Once the first rocket is launched, ffs sort out science a bit. Modularise, and make sure they are each getting the resources for ~1/s, and no one is getting starved or causing back-ups. For eg purple and gold probably need more than four assemblers each.

Need a circuits factory, but should the one factory support Gold science, and RCUs and module production? Probably. Just split em up. Also split gold/Red appropriately before they get to the speed1 and blue circs. 

Rip out steam.
Better defences - prepare for behemoths. 

Fill in lake, make some hazard concrete and get stuff set up RIGHT. Proper main bus. Only four lines required (plus acid and lb).

Automate building satellites (limited to 1): 5 radar, 100 accum (batteries), 100 LDS, 100 solar, 50 fuel, 100 blue circuits, solar panels, steel, circuits, 

Lay on more Cu and more Fe. Maybe train them in. 

Destroyer capsules. 
More Level 3 assemblers (need 300 - pinch some Speed1s)

Empty inventory. Tear it all down. Begin anew (except for the tank farms). Srsly. Start over. Shift chests and tanks first. More bots of both kinds.

6	Green
20	Red
4	Blue
4	PI
2	PII
1	PIII I have a decent stock of circuits. Should devote a few assemblers to PIIIs over at the western circuit fab.

Maybe another circuits factory down by the uranium processing outpost. Bring that 8m Cu patch online. Need a tank. Destroyers. Make some space. Set up smelter farm. Set up power somewhere safe. Go from there. Two new reactors.

Solve each in turn. Go with half portions, to begin with. If I need 40K red science at 0.5/s == 22 hours, which is fine. Can always slam early science faster. Even at 1/s it's still only ~10 hours.

Red:5.5s,  Fe-> 1/2 belt of cogs, plus 1/2 belt of Cu. 3 factories. Easy. Try to avoid filter inserters. They suck when things get backed up. Avoid chests.
8 deep (1 layer of assemblers)

Green:8.8s, Single Cu-> Coils -> Green <-Fe, Single cogs -> belt. Single Basic, Single Yellow belt, 4 green science factories

Smelter array
Markings for 16 lanes of ore up the middle; 8 Cu, 8 Fe, balanced with splitters. Six arrays of 40 with 20s melters on each side. Two further arrays of Steel. Maybe just belt it in, rather than getting fancy with direct supply. If steel backs up, Fe can just carry on its merry way. 

A blue belt will transport 2.4K/minute. 
A single cargo wagon has 40 slots:

2000 ore, or 4000 plates or 8K circuits.

Can probably only support 100 plates/second all in, to begin with. Leave room to grow. Just split the Fe into thirds, and send a third to steel. Shift its array if it gets in the way. 80 steel smelters ~=10 steel/s, which is needed for my 0.5 science/second factory.. 
Collect ore from drop-off marshalling stations. Or just have multiple trains. Dump and run. Pick up and run. Maybe have a dropoff station for each resource, so backing up one won't back up the others. Cu, Fe, Steel, and Plastic. Coal and bricks can just be belted in. Develop Eastern Iron, and train ore in to the smelter array. Let trains each train empty before it returns for more ore. More atomics. Set up lines for belts. Maybe head off on a RSO-style ore-density mission. Straight south in the tank, blasting a path. Take some landfill along just in case.

Two trains. Bring in HSO4, Lb, to replenish tanks

Four carriages:
plastic/red circuits
Steel

Bring back wood and stone for off-load.
Make a few figure-8s for trains to turn around, etc.

Get that big uranium patch online, stat. Using u-238 pretty quickly, now. Will need quite a bit more to clear a perimeter. Also for depleted U bullets for turrets.
Requires acid (crude or sulphur; water, Fe) and power. Maybe just tank in the acid.
If I double-rail the line, it can likely move a five-wagon train every five seconds = five * 8K plates = 480K plates/minute. Need 84K/minute for 3 science/second.
50K plates/min will fill 20 express belts... Need to move away from belts. Have factories feed/from chests and cargo wagons directly.
Valuable outpost, so solid defence. Looked after by a bot outpost.
Needs more acid. Better sort that. A 5:1 train should do.
Build a train refuelling depot. Have em refuel on the way south.

Keep going south. Maybe another week. Maybe boost atomics for the push. Destroyers are keeping up fine.

Can snake it, into three lengths of 24, for 72 smelters.
Then it's 144x9, instead of 432x3
Five snakes is 14 in each snake = 84 x 15
Seven snakes (nice balance) is 10 in each = 60 x 21
Nine snakes is 8 long, so 48 x 24
11 snakes is 
15 snakes is 5 long, so 30 x 45
Right. Let's go with three snakes of 26. First snake, swap at half way, take off at the end. Second snake, likewise with splitter half way, and all goes onto one side at the end. Third snake all one side, and re-combine with the first snake at the end. Each snake is:

B>XXXXXX<B = 10x13 long = 130 long and 9 wide.

B>XXXOOO<BB>XXXXXX<BB>XXXOOO<BB>XXXXXX<B
L XXXOOO PL XXXXXX PL XXXOOO PL XXXXXX P
B<XXXOOO>BB<XXXXXX>BB<XXXOOO>BB<XXXXXX>B

B>XXXOOO<BB>XXXXXX<BB>XXXOOO<BB>XXXXXX<B
L XXXOOO PL XXXXXX PL XXXOOO PL XXXXXX P
B<XXXOOO>BB<XXXXXX>BB<XXXOOO>BB<XXXXXX>B

Could potentially run in two express belts to half way, then run two belts out. Just to fill in that gap. It would then run to five switchbacks of 30 smelters. (150x15) 10 such would be 150x150 (1500 smelters, 850 plate/s (51K/min), a four-wagon train in under 10s)
A quarter of this is 75x75, 375 smelters, 15 in each run. Much better. One roboport in the middle with all the loot (380 smelters, 380 fast, 380 basic, 760 UG, poles, lights). 

15 snakes is 9x15=135wide. 15x26=1170
Less beacons(?) and roboports. Ports construct 100x100 and interact 50x50
For a 130x135 square, need 25 roboports for full coverage. Or five roboports in the middle, in an X-shape, 50-in from each corner, and one in the centre with the:
1070 smelters
1070 fast inserters
1070 basic inserters
2140 underground express belts. In stacks of 50, this is 43 stacks. Better get some more factories on this. Requires only Fe plate and lb. Rail in the lb and make onsite?
535 lights
535 small power poles
Other four roboports
Construction bots

Start with four lines; 2 for Fe, 2 for Cu.
Maybe make up a fluids train: acid/lb. Can turn around after dropping lb.
300 smelters; 600 ugbelts (12 stacks); 300 fast; 300 basic; 150 lights, poles
2 lanes will handle four wagons of ore in 94s, and fill a plates train in 3 mins 08.
Plenty for now. Requires 160 of each miner. Ore trains can use the main trunk, if they're careful. Maybe don't need so many locos. 2:4? Local refuelling spot. One train for each ore patch. Count miners on big Cu patch. It could be 100. Start a blueprint, and it will count all the stuff in frame. Feed ore haulers coal. 

Get southern uranium enrichment running.



Clear encroaching alien bases. ONGOING

Blueprint for entire bootstrap factory, reproduce down south.
Include LevelIII assemblers.

Go until the first 100m ore patch, or until I have 2K ProdIII modules (120/hour ~= 15 hours..), then find the promised land. A nice big desert, with at least 500m of Fe/Cu within reach. Get some productivity/speed modules into play for green circuits.

North base can keep ticking over making nukes, power, modules.
Rebuild bootstrap base to the south, and set up science aiming for 2/s.
Plan B: Send plates, circuits, plastic, batteries, coal, bricks south. Trouble is, I am enjoying heading south.

Make batteries at oil site? Send science packs north.
LDS (Steel, plastic, copper)
RCU (circuits)
Fuel (oil)

IIIIII-IIIIII-IIIIII-IIIIII-Engine-Engine-Engine-Engine-Engine
Space for three trains, each ~70 tiles long. Re-fuelling for locos.
200 across the top. Two signals and one stop. Unload/refuel to the right.

Maybe have a stack of three Fe and three Cu unloaders, all named the same. Only ever use three of each train. That's quite a lot of thru-put. 6K/min = 100/s, or 2.5express.

Switch directions of the main trunk, and all the stations (so that signals can go on the 'right'.
Separate the main trunk into blocks. Each 60-tile waiting block needs to be solidly defended (on account of waiting trains full of valuable loot). Have the signal blocks at each end of the 60-tile segment, so the same gear can defend a train going in each direction. Maybe a blueprint. Turrets, signals, walls, radar, bot hub, repair packs, bots, replacement gear, power poles, gates. A siding to replace used-up bits. Resupply train timing based on inactivity. Split the long run into 10? sections. Find out how to find coordinates...

Measure first, with a real train, I guess. Maybe allow for a couple of extra carriages.
~140 walls
4 gates
8 laser turrets
1 roboport
11 small power poles
Build on existing pylon (not in plan (neither are rails))
1 radar
2 signals
4 lights
1 rail stop (for unloading supplies)?
Concrete? Would need ~400 per. 
Hazcrete alongside and under the rails. ~250 per.
1 supply chest containing, walls, turrets, radar, gates, rails, bots, poles, repair packs
Supply chest could be blocked off for only those items, and in line with carriage number 1
Some drones. Damaged trains flying through may peel off some to their doom..

10 such will require 
1400 walls
40 gates
80 turrets
10 roboports
110 poles
10 radars
20 signals
40 lights
4K concrete
2.5K haz concrete
10 supply chests

Ensure there's always a standing bay for each train in use. 

Keep northern green circuits on life support. Can re-supply from southern ore, until southern circuits is fully online. Northern ore patches are holding out fairly well.
One full express belt per cargo wagon will fill it:
with ore in 50s
with plate in 100s
with circuits in 3.5mins

One refinery takes 20 crude/s; output 2heavy, 9light, 11petrol
heavy -> Lb/Light. Light -> rocket fuel. Petrol -> plastic + sulphur (10:1).
One pumpjack can produce 100/s max
So.. five refineries to one pumpjack? Need to dig into that.
May have to train water to the refining station, or oil to a lake. 50:100 - you're better to train water to oil, than oil to water. One 75K wagon of water will run a refinery for 
2 hours*4. Four wagons will feed 10 refineries for 50 mins. One train and a circuit network. Or, like, a pump. 2EZ.


Shift drop point for green circuits, and sort out underneathies to the main bus.

Get production of refineries automated (spur from purple science). DONE
Check/supersize u/ground belt production DONE romping along
Swap sides for trunk rail. Remove unwanted spurs, and place basic placeholder for full break point. Line up on pylon. DONE.

Get uranium mining going again (needs acid load/unload spurs, and kickstarter U235)
Rail signals DONE
main trunk sections (F5 + map view?). 10 chunks. DONE
Time to head south. First:
	Sort loader for acid
	Sort layby for resupply train
	Sort autoloader for resupply train with assemblers, inserters, miners, smelters,
		ugrounds, refineries, belts, poles, lasers, walls, gates, lights, bots, botports,
		nukes, ammo, destroyers, track, landfill
	For this trip, prioritise U235, refineries, pipes, upipes, chem factories, tanks
	General refuelling, double-wide, with space for six trains (incl the two refuelling)
Uranium site. Sort it out. Maybe make ammo onsite. Acid in, U235 out. Make nukes at main base. Does anything consume U238 other than ammo? Yes. Fuel = 19:1.
40:5 -> 41:2. Maybe have the 2 go onto the inner ring, fresh U238 on the outer ring only. The inner ring swaps to the outer. New U238 applied via inserter, only when there's space.

Maybe play with ore haulier test, at this point. 

Oil site. Refineries, tanks, chem factories, pipes
	In: water, crude, Fe, Cu. Plate buffers supplied by plate trains - inactivity
	Out: batteries, acid/acid/Lb, plastic, rocket fuel (just enough for trains, at first)
	One dedicated train, 5:4:1. Stops at Main Bus (acid, plastic, rocket fuel, Lb), 
	refuel, Uranium (acid), (eventually also S Circuits (acid))
Ore process site. Ore hauliers: 1:4. Should be fairly well protected.
	Set up two 75-long, 5-fold snakes. Would be nice to just use the one, but how to manage blockages? Have the plate buffer call for ore when it gets low. Let full ore trains wait in a siding until called. Maybe they wait at home. Stop calling for trains when buffer is above a  certain point. To begin with, just one of each train. Needs to wait until *plates* are getting low. Get signal from plate buffer to *appropriate* ore haulier by activating the unload station. That could work, but what stops all the other trains piling in? Three snakes coming out, and are filtered to each Plate bay. One buffer for  each type (Fe, Cu, St). Means I only need one generic ore unload bay, and  no ore buffer. The incoming load should replenish the plate, not exceed the available buffer. Can the station be renamed on the fly, by the requesting plate buffer? Can the resulting buffer call a particular train, based on the resource type? "It's steel - call the steel train". No, a shared plates buffer would have to empty between uses, and I don't want that. Need three pickup stations, each with space for three trains. Plate trains sit until empty, before reloading. Maybe have ore trains wait by the plate pickup, until it 'turns on' the ore station by getting too low. Can it turn on/request a particular ore type? Get three loads in quick succession to replenish the buffer. Having three empty unloader stations seems a bit wasteful. Generic ore hauliers? Just wait in a siding, and the next cab off the rank goes off and collects the ore? Or just one generic ore hauler? Something is low, go get the thing, from the place with the most of it on hand
	
M'kay. Here's how it ought to work:
	I have several outposts mining Cu ore, and several mining Fe ore. Among each ore type, they confer, and activate the stop of the one with the most ore of each type.
	Either PLATE buffer runs low, and requests more plate.
	For a stop to be fully active, it must have the largest buffer of its type AND
		get the nod from the plate buffers. Once the hauler leaves, the station 
		needs to stay active/selected until the ore hauler leaves with its load of ore.

Here's now it could work:
	Dropoff buffers - one for Cu, one for Fe. Always topped off by trains on circuits. 
	Come back each time, wait till empty, go to the next one.
	Buffers output to the belts when their plates get low. 
	Cu and Fe can go at the same time.
	They stop unloading when their plate buffer is > $max. 
	The plate buffer can handle quite a bit of overage. Time an ore takes to travel 
	5*75 tiles at 5.625m/s, plus 1.75s for smelting = 68.5s of delay.
	Four blue belts can smelt 10K ore in that time. Three chests. 
	Meh, fine. Lay on a buffer of 8 chests. Four blue lines -> 8 red lines 160/s.
	
Umm, actually need 1000 furnaces, so maybe having a single big run ain't such a hot idea.
I still like the idea of serial processing, tho.
1000 furnaces require ~600 ore/s = 15 blue belts = 15 snekes = 1125 smelters.

16 snekes could be fed from four ore dropoffs. The low one is the active one. Parked trains are useless trains, tho. Maybe if a train has more to go and its time is up, it goes to the lowest one. Need some kind of load balancing down the track, I suppose. Sorting it upstream sounds like a better idea, tho.

16 snakes of 75 smelters = 1200 smelters, in four groups of four snakes.
Input/output at one end means output can govern input (68s delay, notwithstanding)
Maybe directly control belts (no) or inserters, based on plates levels. If it goes over $max, the inserters stop unloading ore, and the ore trains wait. What if all the ore trains are on copper, but we need iron?
The train station needs to send it away, sooner or later, if the unloaders are shared.
If unloaders are split, then no probs. Train unloads, waiting train waits in a stacker. Separate ore loading, too. Waiting trains in a stacker. The only circuit required is the empty plate chests unloading more ore. The inserters can all go at once. All they care about is 'are my plates low?'. Unload stations need to deactivate if they are full. Let ore haulers get out of the way of plate haulers. Plate haulers, likewise, need to get out of the way of ore haulers. Maybe they  actually need to be able to work at the same time.. A blockage with one will block the other. Ok, a pair of trains. 
Belt inserter chest inserter track space space track inserter chest inserter belt 
Can two snakes be fed 'back to back'?
One snake will handle 40/s, so will deplete a chest of ore in 50s.
Need four modules of four snakes. One can be steel.
Four loader/unloader stations, each with four loader/unloader chests. 
If they are six tiles apart, the whole array will be 18 + (3*4) * 16 = 210 wide x 93 deep. Maybe have it on its side. I have plenty of N/S space. Loader/unloaders will likely take another 100 tiles. A plates train is ~60 long.
If I have four pickup/drop-off areas, there will be problems with who has the most. 
If I have one, it will need to handle 500 ore/s in, and 500 plate/s out.
Using 16 chests. That will use and ore-train in 16s, and fill a plates train in 32s.
Stack inserters can each shift 12/s, so 12 can shift unload a cargo wagon in 14s. Can I research another stack size increase? Would need ore hauliers all lined up, ready to unload - one every 16s. More likely is we keep the split between Fe and Cu.. And that's just for 60spm.

The loader/unloader is 18 wide if serviced by loader/unloader trains, each with double-sided chests. The snake can be 18 wide if it's bent into six sections. Then it's only 60 long (12 smelters. 72 smelters in all. Able to handle 41.1 plates/s. About right. 
Splitting into 3 with full throughput = 1:2, 2:4 with one feeding back in.

Each blue belt needs a train every ~3.5 mins. One unloader needs a train every 20s.

I think go with one train per sneke. Yes, it's 16 trains, but there's some headroom.\

Can each loader/unloader serve two snekes? Four sections each.
Four sections per = 18 ea. = 72 per.  = 90 deep, by 24 per wide = 96 for four.
One ore train can supply two express belts (one each side) for 100s. For loading the belt, only blue inserters are needed, to keep pace. Will want even filling of plates among all four cargo wagons. 1:2:4 on each side. 48 blue inserters can likely keep pace to transfer from/to chests/belts. Maybe even basics. Stack inserters for wagon/chest, tho.
Double chests for ore, single chests for plates because they stack to 100. 
One ore train every 90s, one plates train every 3 mins. Per pair of stacks.
A module is two of these, and I need four modules = one plates train every 22s. Woo.
8000x3=24K/min = still not enuf.

300spm (5sps) requires 2300 plates/s; 5000 smelters. 70x70 smelters. Pretty easy, really. No snekes, just rack it through. Two lanes per train. Exit from far end. Easeh.
35 trains in (one every 100s), 35 trains out (one every 200s).
or if it's 72 across; 18 trains in, 18 out. One cargo wagon per row. Should probably be aiming for this. 

Ore haulers with six cargo wagons could each serve six straight 70s, emptying in 50s.

Nothing fancy with mixing ores, just pound it through: Fe trains, Cu trains. One ore hauler is not going to work. 300spm will need a six carriage plate hauler heading north every 10 seconds. Among 18 haulers, this should be okay. 80% only goes as far as circuits/steel, anyway. Will likely need 100 ore patches on the go to feed this. Get ore off belts and into chests asap. Maybe go 2:6 for ore haulers. Keep traffic a little lower.

Each train needs to service ~300 miners = 150/s = a full load among all three in 53s.
If I'm using 3:8 trains, that's a couple of minutes to fill. Just need a 6-min buffer at each ore patch (at least five chests - will be 96, so meh).
			
Two buffers, getting tapped by individual plate trains. 
One triggers its low-value. The ore hauler goes to the appropriate ore reserve, fills up, dumps in the dropoff, and returns to its staging station. Can it cope if all three are low? How does it determine which one to pick up? List of stations: fill up at the low one, probably wait at the other one(s) (low, but train is already full) and return to dropoff. Want to be able to fill the whole train with an ore. Maybe it just goes to all the active stations, in order. It's a bit crap to have to wait, but oh well. Exclusive-OR between the stations? Even if they are both low, both ore stations can't be active at once. Fill one above it's $max capacity before attending to the other? Maybe only the lowest is active (compare them). Just fill the lowest, until both are above their $max. I quite like that. 

if $amount < 16K && $amount < $other_amount then activate ore station
If it delivers a full load, maybe don't need a $max value. 
What if the $amounts are the same (eg 'zero')? Maybe have a single plate circulating on a conveyer, just to break ties.

OK, can't do Steel. That's a shame. Maybe just tap 1/3 of the Fe plate coming out for Steel. Maybe base it on the amount of steel in the system. Tap it off the Fe buffer, as required, to meed minimum demand. Turn on at $low-value, turn off at $high-value. If I run it through the main snake, I'll be left with a bunch of half-loaded smelters, waiting for more Fe. Test the change between Cu and Fe, and (?) stone. One train can likely fill/empty in 40s, run for 20s, so do a loop every minute = 8K ore/min = 133/s, requiring 233 smelters. 

Test loop:
One train+wagon. Station/resource buffer A; Station/resource buffer B; drop-off/waiting station, sorter in the middle. Train goes to station of highest (above a $minimum) resource, picks it up and drops it at the dropoff. Then waits for a station to raise above its $min.

For now, leave the existing Cu/Fe smelter systems ticking over. 
	Buffer runs low of a resource. 
	Request sent to:
		ore train by:
			activating the ore train's loader station. Empty ore hauliers form up behind their load station, at a staging station. Wait condition is existence of the unloader station. No need for staging station, in that case.
			activating a specific ore unloader station
			activating a generic ore unloader station
		an inserter
		a station
		
	Ideally, want three full ore trains waiting in a siding, ready for the call.
	Any low buffer ought to be able to call at any time, and it be fine. Plate buffer can handle three loads of ore. (24K, or six steel chests. Maybe go to 12 chests - for a bit of spare space, that never gets used) Call when supply drops to less than one train load (4K*4=16K) 
	Inserters pull the ore out. Plate loading bay has room for all trains of each type, or somehow calls them from their sidings, one at a time. 3 Fe, 3 Cu, 1 St. Steel train picks up its 'ore' from the Fe Plate buffer. Having only one smelter array will be tricky. Having only one dropoff point will be very tricky. Kludge would be to have three stops, one after the other, and inserters all the way along.
Refuelling site for them (coal)
Sort out main bus feed. underneathies. A pair. Will support 1Sci/second. Belts to begin with is fine, tho. 
Maybe replace plastic/redCircuit; rocket fuel/steel supplies with belts... Nope. Fixed.
Blue underneathies would be fine. 10 per 100 tiles. Maybe 2 stacks would do it. Yeah. Rip out that damn train, it's in the way. Right angles, pls. Start from the bus. At least sort out the carriages. 2:3; iron/copper fuel/steel red/plastic. Park/drain the tankers. lol nope. Fixed.

Set up a lay by at each end for the supplies train. Unloads into supply chests.

Keep researching laser turret damage.

TRAIN BUS for 300spm

From top to bottom.

Green, needs 500/s from 200 factories (from 500Fe/s, 751 Cu/s)
	Green will drain a 5:4 Cu train in 20s. Will need to be modular, built
	around the capacity of one train. Maybe 2Fe wagons : 3Cu wagons.
	Will need to be a large installation, likely using tiled snekes.
	Coil factories along the sides, blue underneathies feeding Fe to Green factories
	up the middle.
	One blue can feed 16 Green LevelIIIs. Need 24 Coils factories per 16.
	A 6:4 matrix works. 
	
	13 of these 16/24 modules required.
	76 deep x (13x11=) 143 wide 
	11 wide is enough for belt inserter box inserter track x2
	Will require significant thruput of Cu/Fe. Can't feed it yet. Laying on
	this amount of ore will require many nukes, so check on Uranium next time
	I'm passing, and maybe get it delivered to the north base on the acid run.
	Once the other centrifuges are up to speed. Maybe build another dozen
	centrifuges, and sort out the network.

Steel, needs 800 smelters (460Fe/s) = 12 snekes

Gears, needs 180Fe/s (one 5:4 every 88s)

Coal 120/s from 230 miners

Plastic (upstream of red) 190/s from 76 factories (80% of the coal)

Red, needs 81/s (300 factories) (from 162 plastic, 162 Green, 162 Cu)/s

==thruput pressure eases here==

Blue circs 13/s from 104 factories (50% of green + 33% of red)

Speed1 7.5/s from 90 factories (46% of red + 7% of green)

Lb 3 chem factories

Batteries 20 factories, acid

Bricks 25/s from 45 smelters (50 stone/s from 77 miners) Trickle in at the end.

Tailored train, once in a while. 
For 300gspm, 72Fe, 2.5St, 38Cu, 25Gear, 25Coal. Coal stack size is 50, so takes 2x as much room, so we'll say 50Coal. (187.5 tot)
38%Fe, 20%Cu, 13%Gear, 26%Coal, 1%Steel
With four wagons = 
6KFe, 3.2KCu, 2KGear, .2KCoal, 200Steel
