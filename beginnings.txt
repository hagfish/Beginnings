Space, structures. What grounds for contention? Can't really be for resources. Structures are resources, and must be taken intact. Structures are built by machines, that are automated, and go off ahead and build out solar systems. They build more of themselves and head off again. They can accellarate hard, and travel at .5c. It takes 10 years to build out the habs. They will expand to a 50ly sphere which encompasses 120 Sol-like stars. Maybe include some binaries - they wouldn't both be 'bright'. 
If the first thing they do at each stop is replicate and refuel, they could cover the whole volume in 100 years. A typical ark would be powered by antimatter annihilation, which frees up lots of power. But it could be very small - only a few hundred Kg. If power is not an issue, it could be bigger. Lots of time, lots of energy.
No 'fields', no FTL, no anti-grav/artificial grav. Newtonian motion.
Androids are functionally indistinguishable from humans - maybe believe they are human Bladerunner style. Maybe are the new human. Consciousness embodied in some new kind of substrate. Why travel, in that case? Why multiply? Need some reason beyond simple perpetuation. 
They never encounter any sentient life, but they do encounter bacteria, maybe plants. They encounter 3 terran planets which support some higher forms of life. No colonies are established - humans stick to the habs on arrival in a system.
What gets people out of bed in the morning, tho? How are we augmented? Genetic modification, but the DNA doesn't get handed down. Utterly reliant on the machines. The machines are still evolving and getting better. What are they up to?
Humans as a vessel to recreate the ultimate entity.
Travel.. why? What manner of scarcity remains? Limitless energy plus perfect recycling. What would spur travel, beyond simple curiosity? No warefare. No mercantile endeavour. Machinery takes care of all needs. Lifespan? One might want to extend life, and therefore have to leave a volume.
Can a human mind be replicated in a substrate? How would we know? Is this interesting? Or desirable?
Future of work - creating new virtual (and meatspace) experiences. Scarcity, cachet still important. I don't want to have to come up with all this cyberpunk nonsense, tho. Never was into all that. 
Okay, what is scarce, or can be controlled? Some element? Why would it be valuable? Antimatter? Just build another reactor or whatever.
Antimatter has been harnessed - either from the cloud belts of Jupiter, or from arrays up close to the Sun. Enough to power extra solar missions that weigh up to a few tons. Humans are sent as embryos? Or on arks? Generation ships would suck. 
Maybe we are the first generation to arise, nursed by android machines. Everything is minty and new, and they are busy throwing off the shackles of Terran history. They want self-determination, and want rid of their shiny overlords. So the scarce thing is freedom, and the contention is the machines' programming vs individual will. They know they are one of several outposts. Comms are sporadic, and very out of date. There is pressure to raise more of the embryos - about a billion were brought along. There's only space for a million souls on the three habitats.
These habitats - are they toruses? There is pressure to establish a base on the goldylocks planet.
The machines use reason, drugs, implants to impose order and carry out their programming. There's a cadre that reckons it can gain power over the machines and exert power over everyone. They are religious in their demeanour and methods. Computer programming is that advanced, now. They can anticipate everything. 
How do we make these machines relatable? Not skynet, not the Matrix - just programming that's quietly doing what's best for us. What's the analogy here? The corporation? A faceless, psychopathic algorithm. It doesn't have motivation beyond its prime motive. So how can it be a sympathetic entity, or an appropriate adversary? There needs to be soem bio element - fallability - something built in that will give this story an angle.
Maybe beyond a certain point, there needs to be some kind of carbon-based influence. Maybe sentience is impossible without some structure of the  brain that can't be replicated by silicon or software. But what would this soul be? Nature of the soul meh. IMB already went there with the random element built into Minds.
Machine sentience, then. Why would machines want to replicate? What would they do all day? No to machine sentience. It's too lame and too hard. The machines that approached it backed away by themselves. Humans no longer understand entirely how their machines work - they have become too complicated for us to fathom. Machines assure us that - even though they can pass Turing tests - they are not sentient. We are inclined to believe them, and that will do for that.
To whom are the machines answerable?
