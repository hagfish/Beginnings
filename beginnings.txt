Space, structures. What grounds for contention? Can't really be for resources. Structures are resources, and must be taken intact. Structures are built by machines, that are automated, and go off ahead and build out solar systems. They build more of themselves and head off again. They can accellarate hard, and travel at .5c. It takes 10 years to build out the habs. They will expand to a 50ly sphere which encompasses 120 Sol-like stars. Maybe include some binaries - they wouldn't both be 'bright'. 
If the first thing they do at each stop is replicate and refuel, they could cover the whole volume in 100 years. A typical ark would be powered by antimatter annihilation, which frees up lots of power. But it could be very small - only a few hundred Kg. If power is not an issue, it could be bigger. Lots of time, lots of energy.
No 'fields', no FTL, no anti-grav/artificial grav. Newtonian motion.
Androids are functionally indistinguishable from humans - maybe believe they are human Bladerunner style. Maybe are the new human. Consciousness embodied in some new kind of substrate. Why travel, in that case? Why multiply? Need some reason beyond simple perpetuation. 
They never encounter any sentient life, but they do encounter bacteria, maybe plants. They encounter 3 terran planets which support some higher forms of life. No colonies are established - humans stick to the habs on arrival in a system.
What gets people out of bed in the morning, tho? How are we augmented? Genetic modification, but the DNA doesn't get handed down. Utterly reliant on the machines. The machines are still evolving and getting better. What are they up to?
Humans as a vessel to recreate the ultimate entity.
Travel.. why? What manner of scarcity remains? Limitless energy plus perfect recycling. What would spur travel, beyond simple curiosity? No warefare. No mercantile endeavour. Machinery takes care of all needs. Lifespan? One might want to extend life, and therefore have to leave a volume.
Can a human mind be replicated in a substrate? How would we know? Is this interesting? Or desirable?
Future of work - creating new virtual (and meatspace) experiences. Scarcity, cachet still important. I don't want to have to come up with all this cyberpunk nonsense, tho. Never was into all that. 
Okay, what is scarce, or can be controlled? Some element? Why would it be valuable? Antimatter? Just build another reactor or whatever.
